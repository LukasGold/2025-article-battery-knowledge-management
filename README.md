# Semantic Resources for Managing Knowledge in Battery Research
A repository containing resources linked with the article, "Semantic Resources for Managing Knowledge in Battery Research."

## Getting Started
This repository includes Jupyter notebooks, example JSON-LD files, and time-series test datasets that demonstrate semantic approaches to managing battery research data. To run the notebooks and explore the examples, follow these setup instructions.

### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Using a virtual environment ensures that dependencies do not interfere with other Python projects.

#### **Using `venv` (Standard Python Virtual Environment)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Linux use: source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Requirements
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open a notebook of interest.
